        <p id = aboutPara1>Smosh was created by two best friends, Ian and Anthony, in 2005.They first started creating lipsyncing videos to popular children TV shows and movies like
            <i>Power Rangers, Mortal Kombat, </i> and <i>Pokémon </i>on <i>Smosh.com</i>, but they later moved to posting on YouTube instead. One of Smosh's earliest YouTube posts,
            <i>Pokemon Theme Song</i> in November 28, 2005, became the most viewed YouTube video with 4,300,000 views at the time. 
        </p>
        <p id = aboutPara2>As Smosh grew, more regular cast members were introduced in 2015. <i>Keith Leak II, Noah Grossman, Olivia Sui, Courtney Miller, </i>and <i>Shayne Topp</i> were incorporated into most of the videos and are still prominent cast members in the current cast.
        2 years later Anothony left Smosh to pursue more creative outlooks on YouTube. Along with a few changes, they introduced their first game show, <i>"You Posted That?"</i> and featured other YouTubers as contestants. </p>
        <p id = aboutPara3>
            Between 2019 and 2023, Smosh was owned by Rhett and Link through <i>Mythical Entertainment</i>. They also introduced a sub channel, <i>Smosh Pit</i>, along with more new regular cast members, <i>Damien Haas, Spencer Agnew, Tommy Bowe, Amanda-Lehan-Canto, Kimmy Jimenez(left in 2023), Jacklyn Uweh(left in 2023), Chanse McCrary, Angela Giarratana, and Arasha Lalani.</i>
            Through this ownership Smosh continued to post seperate content that wasn't directly intertwined with Rhett and Link. 
            In the second half of 2023 Ian and Anthony bought most of Smosh from Mythical and started producing and directing more comedy sketches, more game related videos, and new shows.
