     <h1>Code Log 1: HTML Semantic Tags</h1>
     <h2>What is the difference between non-semantic and semantic tags in HTML?</h2>
     <p> Non-semantic tags don't clearly define their purpose or meaning in the name itsself like semantic tags do, making them more generic. Semantic tags describe the kind of content they will contain and provides more information for better understanding.</p>
	 <p><b>Example of Non-semantic tags:</b> "<div>" tags group any kind of content together in sections, but it doesn't provide meaning to it.</p>
	 <p><b>Example of Semantic tags: </b>"<p>" tags specify content is represented as a paragraph rather than just a group of text.</p>
     <h2>What are two (or more) benefits of using semantic tags?</h2>
     <p><b>Search Engine Optimisation:</b> Semantic tags impact a webpage's rankings in Google's algorithms by its placement of certain semantic keywords they use.</p>
     <p>Semantic tags make content on a webpage more accessible through better web navigation, benefiting people with disabilities to navigate them easily.</p>
     <p>Semantic tags make code more readable to others with the descriptive semantic names that already states its main purpose.</p>
