<h2>How does a CSS media query work, and why is it useful?</h2>
    <p>
        A CSS media query is a way to style different versions of the same site based
        on what type of device screen layout you are using. This is very useful because
        it is adaptable to more users by providing more than one viewing options.
    </p>

<h2>What "media features" are supported by media queries - such 
    as "orientation" or "max-width" - and what do they do?</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            
           <li><b>Height: </b> "Defines the height of the viewpoint. This can be a specific number..or a range."</li>
           <li><b>Resolution: </b>"Defines the target pixel density of the device."</li>
           <li><b>Aspect-Ratio: </b>"Defines the width-to-height aspect ratio of the viewport." </li>
           <li><b>Environment Blending: </b>"A method for determining the external environment of a device, such as dim or excessively bright places."</li>
        </ul>
