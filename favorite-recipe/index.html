            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Add your cream cheese, shredded crab, salt, and black pepper into a medium bowl and mix them together.</li>
                <li>Use parchment paper and line the bottom of a baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Place 1 tablespoon of filling in the middle of a wonton wrapper. Dip your finger in the small bowl of water and trace the sides of the inside of the wonton.</li> 
                <li>Fold the sides of the wrapper in half so the corners are touching. <i>Refer to the image for visual guidance.</i></li>
                <li>In a wok, add oil to about 3 inches deep. Heat the oil over medium heat to 350 degrees F. Fry the wontons in batches, making sure it doesn't over crowd, for about 2-3 minutes, until golden brown.</li>
                <li>Transfer them to a plate lined with paper towels and continue frying the rest of the wontons in batches.</li>
                <li>Let them cool down, then serve them with the Sweet and Sour Sauce. </li>
            </ol>
