       <p id = "p3first">The grandmother lived deep within the forest, far from the small village. While walking on the path she encountered a wolf, unfazed by it, she converses with, "Good Morning, Mr. Wolf" "Where are you headed?" the wolf replied. "To see my grandmother", relpied Little Red Riding Hood. "What's in the basket?" the wolf curiously asked. "Some cake and wine. My grandmother's sick, so my mother sent me to go check up on her". </p>
       <p id = "p3second">"And 'where does your grandmother live?'" the wolf asked curiously. "She's a bit farther into the woods, passing a few oak trees and bushes." The wolf's hunger for the girl's grandmother grew after each sentence.

       <p id = "p4first">He accompanied the girl for a bit through the forest. However, he had to distract the girl in order to reach the house before her,so he had to distract her. "Hey Little Red, would your grandmother like these flowers?" he asked. "Oh! how perceptive of you! I'm sure she would love them!" she exclaimed. After picking the first one she would find another and another, leading her deeper and deeper into the forest. </p>
       <p id = "p4second">After losing her, the wolf bolted to the grandma's house and knocked. "Who is it?" grandma asked. "It's me - Little Red Riding Hood, I'm delivering some cake and wine from mother!" Grandma asks "Little Red" to let herself in as she was too ill to do so. Immediatly afer opening the door, the wolf ran to the old lady and swallowed her whole. Then he disguised herself in her clothes and waited patiently in the bed.

        <p id = p5first> When Little Red reached the cottage, she noticed the door was already open and felt uneasy. "Good morning grandma! How are you?" she asked cautiously. No reply. She still had to attend to her grandma, so she goes in and draws the cutains open. She stared noticing her grandma looked a bit odd.</p>
        
        <p id = p5second> Sitting at the bed's side her curiosity started to grow. She starts asking her <i>grandma</i>, "Oh, what big ears you have!" <i>"The better to hear you with." </i>the wolf responded. "But, your eyes are huge!" <i>"Better to see you with., my child."</i> "And what big hands you have!" <i>"The better to hug you with."</i> "What a big mouth you have, Grandma!" <i> "All the more to EAT YOU WITH"!</i> the wolf yelled as he jumped from the bed and swallowed Little Red Riding Hood.</p>
